# Backdoorplz
Adds a user "$" with password "Backdoor123!" to the local admin group. <br>
DLL and EXE, both x86 and x64 work fine.<br>
no precompiled headers<br>

**WARNING: RUN EXE or SIDELOAD DLL as high integritry (Admin or system context) or it will NOT work** 

reason why user is called $ is because it won't show up in net users thx to @Ben0xA
